## Project Description
Amsterdam is one of the most sustainable cities in the world: it is now ranking fifth on the Green City Index of European
capitals. - Include some examples here about sustainability in Amsterdam. - The city council has sustainability high on the political agenda and actively promotes it by for example supporting projects promoting sustainability and subsidising certain sustainability efforts by citizens. In this project we analyse sustainability indicators for the different areas of Amsterdam and whether it is related to wealth indicators such as house prices or income. 

Write a short introduction to your project: 3-5 sentences about the context of your topic and why you chose it.

## Questions & Hypotheses
We investigate the following questions: 
- How do sustainability indicators vary among different areas of Amsterdam?
- Is there a link between sustainability indicators and wealth indicators in Amsterdam?

We expect that some areas of Amsterdam are overall more sustainable than others, and that sustainability indicators might be positively correlated with wealth indicators such as house prices or income, so that wealthier areas score are more sustainable. 

## Dataset
We used the following datasets:
XX from the data portal of the Amsterdam city council website
