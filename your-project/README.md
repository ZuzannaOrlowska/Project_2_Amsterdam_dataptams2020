## Project Description
Amsterdam is one of the most sustainable cities in the world: it is now ranking fifth on the Green City Index of European
capitals. - Include some examples here about sustainability in Amsterdam. - The city council has sustainability high on the political agenda and actively promotes it by for example supporting projects promoting sustainability and subsidising certain sustainability efforts by citizens. In this project we analyse sustainability indicators for the different areas of Amsterdam and whether it is related to wealth indicators such as house prices and income. 

Write a short introduction to your project: 3-5 sentences about the context of your topic and why you chose it.

## Questions & Hypotheses
We investigate the following questions: 
- How do sustainability indicators vary among different areas of Amsterdam?
- Is there a link between sustainability indicators and house prices in Amsterdam?
- Is there a link between sustainability indicators and income in Amsterdam?

We expect that some areas of Amsterdam are overall more sustainable than others, and that sustainability indicators might be positively correlated with income and house prices. 

## Dataset
We used the following datasets:
XX from the data portal of the Amsterdam city council website
XX from X

What dataset (or datasets) did you use? What is the source of your data? Provide links to the data if available and describe the data briefly.

## Database
What is the structure of your database? Have you created more than one table and if yes, how are they related to each other? Include a drawing or computer-generated image of the ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram) of your database.

## Workflow
Starting with the general topic of sustainability, we searched for relevant datasets to see what's available, after which we refined our questions. Next, we 

Outline the workflow you used in your project. What are the steps you went through?

## Organization
We created a kanban board to plan the different steps of the project (see link below)
Our repository contains the following folders:
We used jupyter notebooks for our code. 

What does your repository look like? Explain your folder and file structure.

## Links
Include relevant links (that point to google drive or data sources) to your repository, slides, data, database, ERD, and kanban board. Feel free to include any other links associated with your project.
